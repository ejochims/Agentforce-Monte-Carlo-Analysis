  PURPOSE:
    GenAiPlugin is the Agentforce "Topic" — it groups one or more GenAiFunctions
    (actions) under a logical capability area. When you add this plugin to an
    Agentforce Agent, the agent gains the ability to run revenue forecasts.

  HOW TO ATTACH TO AN AGENT:
    In Salesforce Setup → Agentforce → Agents → [Your Agent] → Topics:
    1. Click "Add Topic"
    2. Select "Revenue_Forecasting" from the list
    3. The agent will now automatically invoke Run_Revenue_Forecast when
       users ask forecast-related questions

  ADDING MORE ACTIONS:
    If you create additional forecast-related GenAiFunctions (e.g., a
    "Pipeline Summary" or "Forecast by Rep" action), add them here:
      <genAiFunctions>
          <functionName>Your_New_Function</functionName>
      </genAiFunctions>

  DEPLOY ORDER:
    GenAiFunction:Run_Revenue_Forecast must be deployed before this plugin.

  DEPLOY:
    sf project deploy start -m "GenAiPlugin:Revenue_Forecasting" --target-org <alias>
